Hi, I’m Erica, a data enthusiast with a background in computer science and a soon-to-be graduate with a Master’s in Data Science (April 2025). Currently, I work in the pharmaceutical industry as a Quality Software Systems Specialist, but my true passion lies in uncovering insights from data and building intelligent systems.

My skills include Python, R, SQL, and SAS, and my interests are deeply rooted in machine learning, NLP, and autonomous agents. I enjoy tackling complex problems, whether it’s training deep learning models or aligning AI with human values.

For my master’s capstone, I’m diving into Voice Biometric Authentication, leveraging vector embeddings and large language models (LLMs) to enhance security and verification systems. I’ve also worked on a dense neural network for classification case study and explored AI alignment with human values in a research project.

As I transition into the field, I’m looking for machine learning engineer and data science roles with a focus on machine learning. I thrive on working with real-world data, solving problems, and continuously learning to push the boundaries of AI-driven solutions.

Let’s connect—I'd love to collaborate, learn, and contribute to impactful data science projects!
